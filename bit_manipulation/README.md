# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulatin bits.

## Bitwise Operators

### & or AND:
Is a binary operator to compare two binary numbers, copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.

### | or OR:
Is a binary operator to compare two binary numbers, copies a bit if it exists in eather operand.

### ^ or XOR:
Is a binary operator to compate two binary numbers, copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.

### ~ or NOT:
Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the efect of 'flipping' bits.

### <<:
Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

### >>:
Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
